# atom-current [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/james1345/atom-current.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/james1345/atom-current)

Git and Git Flow integration for atom

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `apm install atom-current`

## Documentation
Integrates git in an easy to use way into the atom editor.

A panel is opened for the current project, where files that have been modified
can be selected to include in the next commit. Simply typing a message and
hitting return will commit the files. Hitting return with an empty commit message
will push the current branch to origin. (thus, typing a message and double hitting
return will commit and push - because git shoudln't get in your way)
